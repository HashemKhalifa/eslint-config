# Eslint auto generated config for all ⚓

A CLI to generate Eslint configuration with or without style guide like airbnb or standardjs


The config can be generated in React, Typescript and NodeJS


In your project run `npx linting.json` and pick your favorite config.


Let's pick React as an example
```javascript
❯ React
  Typescript 
  NodeJS 
```
Pick the style guide
```javascript
❯ react-with-airbnb-config 
  without-style-guide 
  react-with-standard-js 
```

* [Note] The selected config will install all the dependencies


@Todo
- [ ] Add standard JS
- [ ] Refactor the dependency installation

Inspired by [tsconfig](https://github.com/benawad/tsconfig.json)
